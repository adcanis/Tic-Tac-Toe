# Tic-Tac-Toe




![alt text](https://github.com/adcanis/Tic-Tac-Toe/blob/main/images/tictactoeReadme.jpg)

Another project for The Odin Project FullStack JavaScript course. I am choosing to stick with Bulma for my styling options and simple card style layout, as I find these game style projects fit best within a card for a clean UI. 

Overall I felt pretty confident with this project. I was able to apply what I've learned from other projects (Etch a Sketch and Score Keeper) to get the overal jist of this project up and running rather quickly. I did hit a snag with applying the "X" or "O" to the square, as at the time I was only getting one or the other and not alternating between each play. Some Googling and reviewing other answers on StackOverFlow I was able to get that resolved. 

**What I learned**
- How to pull an array out of a nodeList
- How to apply value change to elements inside an array
- How to create "groups" or "combos" out of a said number of elements from the array
- Further improved my ability to troubleshoot and quickly resolve issues as they arise.
